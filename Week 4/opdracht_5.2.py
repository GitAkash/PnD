# Consider the following experiment in which we want to measure the speed of sound. In a
# cylinder, that is open on one side and contains some water, we excite a resonance by blowing
# across the opening (see figure). The frequency of the produced sound is measured. This
# procedure is repeated for different amounts of water. The acquired data is collected in the
# table. When we blow across the opening a standing wave is created that has a node (zero
# amplitude) at the water-air interface and an anti-node (maximum amplitude) just above the
# opening of the cylinder. The distance between node and anti-node is 1 / 4 位, with 位 the wavelength
# of the produced sound. The anti-node is an unknown distance d above the opening. If the
# volume of water is increased, sound with a higher pitch is produced as the distance between
# node and anti-node is reduced. The speed of sound v is related to the frequency (pitch) f and
# the wavelength 位 as: v = f 位.

# Assignment: Determine the speed of sound v and the distance d using the data given. Also
# include their standard errors. Make sure you do all the checks to determine if the fit is valid.

    "So far the code we have dealt with was executed line by line in the same order as they appear in the script. But sometimes you need to execute some code only when a certain condition is met and some other code when this condition is not satisfied. For example if we need to write a script that checks if a number (e.g. a pincode) is equal to some secret number and prints the result to the console, then, depending on the values of the numbers different pieces of code should be executed (e.g. print 'correct' if they are the same and 'wrong' if they are not equal). This behaviour is called branching. In order to apply brancing we require *Booleans* and their use in *logical expressions*."

    "Branching relies on the use of the Boolean type. A Boolean can hold only two values: `True` or `False`. You can define them simply by using an assignment: ` = True` or `c = False`. Boolean are mostly used in *logical expressions*. A logical expression is any expression that evaluates to a Boolean: either `True` or `False`. A very common logical expression is a comparison. For example `3 > 2`, where `>` means larger than, evaluates to a Boolean with value `True`:"

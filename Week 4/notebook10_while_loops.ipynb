    "In a `for`-loop, the indented block of code is executed a predefined number of times. In some cases however, we want the loop to be repeated until a certain condition is met. We can achieve this with a `while`-loop. Instead of having a counter (or a sequence), the loop will run as long as some conditional expression is `True` and will stop iterating when it is `False`. This is illustrated with the following example. When executed it continues to asks the user to enter a number between 1 and 10 until the user guesses the secret number. Finally it prints the number of attempts.\n"
